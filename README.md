I created this script to let all the ACADEMY+PLUS students fix brew easily.

Thanks @bbardi for all your help!

## In order to run it:

#### 1. Check that you have a .brew folder in your home directory. If you don't, `brew update`
#### 2. `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rchioreanu/aplusbrew/master/fixBrew.sh | sh`
#### 3. Done. Enjoy the freedom!
